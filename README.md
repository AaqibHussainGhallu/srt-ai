# SRT AI Translator

Translate SRT files to any language, using AI magic ✨

Say goodbye to subpar auto-generated captions and elevate the user experience with high-quality translations! 🎉

## Overview

SRT AI Translator leverages the power of AI to provide accurate and natural-sounding translations for SRT subtitle files in any language. This easy-to-use tool ensures that viewers can enjoy video content without the frustration of poorly-translated captions.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up SRT AI Translator and start enjoying better translations:

### Prerequisites

- An OpenAI API key (grab it [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), if you don't have one already)
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine

### Installation

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/yazinsai/srt-ai`
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and paste your OpenAI Key.
3. Install dependencies using `npm run install`
4. Start locally using `npm run dev`

You should now be able to access the repo at [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
